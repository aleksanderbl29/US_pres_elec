This repo is meant to organise all my files for the course ***232E24 - The US Presidential Election - Voter Behaviour and Simulation Models***.

It was first used as a place to store all the misc. code for the course. The last place that was done is commit `92a65f0beaeb118778e818ecb7b993f9d5ee9126`.

It is now written as a targets pipeline to make writing the synopsis easier. You should be able to replicate the entire thing with a simple `tar_make()`.
